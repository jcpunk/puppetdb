# [puppetlabs/puppetdb](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb)

The Dockerfile for this image is available in the PuppetDB repository
[here][1].

The PuppetDB container requires a working postgres container or other suitably
configured PostgreSQL database. With that in place, you can run PuppetDB like
so:

    docker run --link postgres:postgres --link puppet:puppet puppet/puppetdb

You can change configuration settings by mounting volumes containing
configuration files or by using this image as a base image. For the defaults,
see the [Dockerfile and supporting folders][2].

For more details about PuppetDB, see the [official documentation][3].

See the [pupperware repository][4] for how to run a full Puppet stack using
Docker Compose.

### Cert File Locations

The directory structure follows the following conventions.  The full path is always available inside the container as the environment variable `$SSLDIR`

- 'ssl-ca-cert'
  `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetdb/certs/certs/ca.pem`

- 'ssl-cert'
  `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetdb/certs/certs/<certname>.pem`

- 'ssl-key'
  `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetdb/certs/private_keys/<certname>.pem`

### Initialization Scripts

If you would like to do additional initialization, add a directory called /docker-custom-entrypoint.d/ and fill it with .sh scripts. These scripts will be executed at the end of the entrypoint script, before the service is ran.

## Analytics Data Collection

 The puppetdb container collects usage data. This is disabled by default. You can enable it by passing `--env PUPPERWARE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true`
to your `docker run` command.

### What data is collected?
* Version of the puppetdb container.
* Anonymized IP address is used by Google Analytics for Geolocation data, but the IP address is not collected.

### Why does the puppetdb container collect data?

 We collect data to help us understand how the containers are used and make decisions about upcoming changes.

### How can I opt out of puppetdb container data collection?

 This is disabled by default.
